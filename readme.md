#Mobile First Skeleton (20px baseline).

This is a fork of [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) made to be used for a Mobile first approach in design and development. In addition to adjusting the media queries and including [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) the type scale is 14px base size with a line-height of 20px.

The media queries have also been changed to avoid the horizontal overflow issue in Firefox. (Firefox doesn't count the vertical scroll bar, 15px, towards screen size. So to remedy that the grid and layout media queries are all adjusted by 15px)
